# Migration from Version 4 to 5

## Changed Behavior & Signature Changes

### 🔒 Final Classes and Inheritance

As a best practice, even if a hydrator (or other classes) is not marked as `final` in this library, extending it is discouraged — future major releases may prohibit inheritance altogether.
Prefer **composition over inheritance** by combining small, focused objects.
Use **decorators** to extend behavior without modifying original classes or creating deep inheritance chains.

### 🧩 Hydrator Plugin Manager

#### ❌ Removal of legacy Zend aliases

All aliases that referenced the equivalent, legacy "Zend" hydrators have been removed. This means that an exception will be thrown if you attempt to retrieve a hydrator using one of these aliases such as `Zend\Hydrator\ArraySerializableHydrator::class`.

You will need to either update your codebase to use known aliases such as `Laminas\Hydrator\ArraySerializableHydrator::class`, or re-implement the aliases in your configuration.

### ❌ Removed Exceptions

The following exceptions have been removed:

- `Laminas\Hydrator\Exception\ExtensionNotLoadedException`
- `Laminas\Hydrator\Exception\InvalidCallbackException`
- `Laminas\Hydrator\Exception\LogicException`

### 🔄 Changes of `Laminas\Hydrator\Strategy\SerializableStrategy`

- Simplified implementation.
- Internal getter and setter methods have been removed.
- If you're relying on these, update your code to use serialization logic externally or via injected services.

### 🔄 Changes to Individual Hydrators

The following deprecated classes (since version 3.0.0) have been removed in version 5.  
Please update your codebase to use the corresponding `*Hydrator` classes:

| Removed Class                              | Replacement Class                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Laminas\Hydrator\ArraySerializable`      | `Laminas\Hydrator\ArraySerializableHydrator`       |
| `Laminas\Hydrator\ClassMethods`           | `Laminas\Hydrator\ClassMethodsHydrator`            |
| `Laminas\Hydrator\ObjectProperty`         | `Laminas\Hydrator\ObjectPropertyHydrator`          |
| `Laminas\Hydrator\Reflection`             | `Laminas\Hydrator\ReflectionHydrator`              |
